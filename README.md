# Smart Contract Workshop - Voting Smart Contract

Welcome to the Smart Contract Workshop - Voting Smart Contract! In this workshop, you will learn about the basics of a simple voting smart contract.

## What Is This Smart Contract?

This smart contract is designed to facilitate a basic voting system. It allows users to create proposals, each with two predefined options (e.g., Coffee and Tea), and cast their votes for their preferred option. The contract ensures that each user can only vote once and keeps track of the vote counts for each option within each proposal.

## Key Features

- **Proposal Creation**: Users can create proposals by providing a description and specifying two predefined options.
- **Voting**: Registered users can cast their votes for one of the two options within a proposal.
- **Preventing Multiple Votes**: The contract prevents users from voting more than once in the same proposal.
- **Vote Counting**: It tracks and displays the vote count for each option in a proposal.
